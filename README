Some fpga codes that have been written with the help of zipcpu's blog.

The designs are written in verilog and the test benches are written in
cpp.

All of these can be simulated with the help of Verilator

Traces can be viewed with the help of gtkwave

TODO
====

- Update the Makefile to reflect the new dir structure (paritally done
  but very dirty).

- The Makefile currently only supports the building of only one file,
  extend this so that we don't have to edit the Makefile too much.

- Update Makefile to support other compilers and not force the user to
  use "g++" for compiling cpp.

- Complete the test bench for fifo.
