Some fpga codes that have been written with the help of zipcpu's blog.

The designs are written in verilog and the test benches are written in
cpp.

All of these can be simulated with the help of Verilator

Traces can be viewed with the help of gtkwave

TODO
====
- Seperate out test benches from design codes.  Perhaps something like

	bench/		<- test benches
	rtl/		<- design codes

- Update the Makefile to reflect the new dir structure.

- The Makefile currently only supports the building of only one file,
  extend this so that we don't have to edit the Makefile too much.

- Update Makefile to support other compilers and not force the user to
  use "g++" for compiling cpp.

- Complete the test bench for fifo.
